The original [Read The Docs](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io)
theme was created for [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), and so it is
designed specifically for documentation.
Combined with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) it's a great and easy
way to document your projects!

Check out the [🚀 quick start guide](https://carlosperate.github.io/jekyll-theme-rtd/quickstart.html)
to see how easy it is to get started.

- ✅ Built-in search functionality using [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/)
- ✅ Source code highlighting using the [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org)
- ✅ Specifically developed to be compatible with GitHub Pages
- ✅ SEO-friendly meta tags and canonical URLs
- ✅ Configurable with custom options in `_config.yml` and front matter
